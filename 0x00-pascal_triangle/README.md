# Pascal's Triangle Generator

## Overview

This Python module, `pascal_triangle.py`, provides a function `pascal_triangle(n)` to generate Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row. Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical structure that starts with a single number (1) at the top and each subsequent row is generated by adding the two numbers directly above it. It has various applications in mathematics and beyond.

## Installation

To use this module, simply download the `pascal_triangle.py` file and import the `pascal_triangle` function into your Python script.

```python
from pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

# Generate Pascal's Triangle up to the 5th row
triangle = pascal_triangle(5)
print(triangle)
# Output:
# [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
